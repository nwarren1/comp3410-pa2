Part1b
Changes made:
1.   la $a0, welcome -> needed to have a0 in order to print
2.  slti $s2, $s1, 0x04 -> changed to 4 because we have 4 interations
3.  j _exit -> replaced system call to close rather than use another label
4. Added the following to print my integers when jal printint was called
printint: #this needed to print integers
		li $v0, 1
		syscall
		jr $ra
Question 2:
The iterations did not work due to slti $s2, $s1, 0x3; we have 4 interations not 3.
Question 3: 
It would have been alot easier to understand what the person was trying to do with comments. 
Modifications to someones code is always easier when they can communicate through comments. 
Communication is critical in all aspects of work and coding.
