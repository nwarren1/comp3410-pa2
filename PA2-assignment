Download the file debugme.asm from the git repo. The program is meant
to add 4 numbers together and print the result; however, it is full of
bugs and doesn't even assemble correctly.

For this part of the assignment, modify the debugme.asm file until it
works as expected and answer the questions below.

1A: 20 points:

* Modify the program to work as expected, adding 4 numbers together and printing the result

* Note that we'll grade this solution by comparing your modifications
  to the original; make as many changes as you need, but make sure you
  correct the original file rather than creating a new solution from
  scratch.

* Submit the modified *.asm file to the git repo.

1B: 10 points

Answer the following questions. Submit your answers in a plaintext
file that you submit to the git repo.

* Approximately how many errors did you find and have to correct?

* Why did the program not perform all the iterations as expected?

* How much easier would the program have been to debug if it had been commented?

This is a warm-up problem to get familiar with file I/O and procedure
calls in MIPS. Check out this page as a helpful resource: http://eisertdev.com/reading-files-in-mips/

Your program will read in a file of integers, one number per line. It
should be capable of managing a file of anywhere from 20-50 lines,
with both positive and negative integers.

After reading in the file and storing the integers, your program must
invoke a procedure that sorts the integers in ascending order.

Print the resulting, sorted integers into an output file.

Submission:

* Turn in the *.asm file with your code.

* Include at least two input files that you've tested
  succesfully. Name them PA2_input1.txt and PA2_input2.txt.

* Include at least two corresponding output files, with the results of
  running your program. Name them PA2_output1.txt and PA2_output2.txt.

For this part of assignment, you will write an assembly language program that
determines the last element in a non-empty, non-circular linked list
of positive integers. 

You must use at least one procedure call in your solution.

For our purposes, a linked list is implemented with an array, and represented as follows:

* A “node” of a linked list has two components: a value and a pointer.

* Any pair of elements in the array, given by A[i] and A[i+1], forms a
  “node” of the linked list.

* For a given node, A[i] contains the value of the node, and A[i+1]
  points to the next element in the linked list. In other words, A[i]
  is the value of the node and A[i+1] is the pointer.

* The A[i+1] “pointer” gives the the array index of the next node. The
element that it points to will always be a “value” element and not a
“pointer” element.

* The array always begins with value/pointer pair A[0] and A[1].  A
null pointer (signifying the end of the list) is represented by -1.

For example, suppose you have linked-list 18->12->5. You could
represent it with this scheme as:

A[0] = 18
A[1] = 4
A[2] = 5
A[3] = -1
A[4] = 12
A[5] = 2

Your program should accomplish the following tasks:

* Read a file that represents an array of size 20, following the scheme defined above.

* Print out the values of the linked list, in order. (Print the values
  ONLY, skipping over the "pointer" elements). 

* When the end of the linked-list is reached, print “end of list at
  position X” where X is the array index where the -1 was found.

* Print these results to a file.

For example, if the input file contains the following (smaller input
for example purposes; remember, your input should contain 20
elements): 
2
2
5
6
8
-1
7
4

Here would be the expected output of your program (saved to a file):

"Here is my linked list: 2->5->7->8. The end of the list was found at position 5."

Submission:

* Include your *.asm file with the program.

* Include a text file with an input linked list of size 20.

* Include an output file with your result.
